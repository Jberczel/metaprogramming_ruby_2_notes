# Chapter 2 - Monday: The Object Model

## Open Classes

Can open standard library classes such as  String and add methods:

```ruby
class String
  def to_alphanumeric(s)
    s.gsub(/[^\w\s]/, '')
  end
end
```

### Inside Class Definitions

No real distniction between code that defines class and any other code. This code doesn't create three classes; it just opens the class definition.

```ruby
3.times do
  class C
    puts 'Hello'
  end
end
```

```
Hello
Hello 
Hello
```

Similarly, the following code doesn't create two classes. It reopens and defines new method:

```ruby
class D
  def x; 'x' end
end

class D
  def y; 'y' end
end
```

```
obj = D.new
obj.x       # => "x" 
obj.y       # => "y"
```

### The Money Example

money gem add set of utilitiy classes for managing money. It allows you to call `Numeric#to_money`:

```ruby
require "money"

standard_price = 100.to_money("USD")
standard_price.format  # => "$100.00"
```

How does it do that? The money gem modifies Numeric class:

```ruby
class Numeric
  def to_money(currency = nil)
    Money.from_numeric(self, currency || Money.default_currency)
  end
end
```

### The problem with Open Classes

Programmers can override original methods for a given class. This can lead to ugly side effects and bugs that are hard to track down.

Openning classes and modifying them is also referred to as "monkeypatching".


## Inside the Object Model

Instance variables live in objects; methods live in classes.

Said differently, instance variables are not shared among objects; however, an object is an instance of a class and shares the same methods.

```ruby
class MyClass
  def my_method
    @v = 1
  end
end
```

```
obj = MyClass.new

obj.my_method
obj.instance_variables             # => [:@v]
```

```
obj.class.instance_methods(false)  # => [:my_method]
```

The false argument filters any inherited methods

### The Truth about Classes

Classes themselves are objects.

Methods of an object are instance methods of its class:

```
"test string".class            # => String
String.class                   # => Class
Class.instance_methods(false)  # => [:allocate, :new, :superclass]
```

A ruby class inherits from its superclass:

```
Array.superclass       # => Object
Object.superclass      # => BasicObject
BasicObject.superclass # => nil
```

BasicObject is the root of the Ruby class hierarchy.
