# Metaprogramming Ruby 2 Notes

My chapter by chapter notes (only Part 1) on [Metaprogramming Ruby 2](https://pragprog.com/titles/ppmetr2/) by Paolo Perrotta.

This was my favorite book for learning Ruby several years ago.  After being away from Ruby for awhile now, I've begun re-reading this book and taking notes on some of the chapters.  

I highly recommend you pick up a copy and work through it as well.
